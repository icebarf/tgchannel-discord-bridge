## Get this shit running

- Copy `login_copy.json` to `login.json`
- Run `python3 generate_login_string.py`
- Copy the generated login string.
- Open `login.json` and modify as specified in [how to fill data](#login.json)
- After you have generated a functional `login.json`, simply run `main.py`
- `python3 main.py`

## login.json

`api_id` - This field is obtained from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). This is the only non-quoted (`"`) field, i.e an integer value

`api_hash` - This field is obtained from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).

`telegram_login_string` - This field is generated by running `generate_login_string.py`.

`discord_token` - This field is obtained from [discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

`media_download` - The location where downloaded media is put if it is larger
than 7.5 Mega Bytes.

`media_url` - The url part which will be posted after moving to `media_download` location. The file name is appended to this URL and posted.
Typically the `media_download` is some location which is accessible via the
web through `media_url` and so it makes sense for me to use them in my case.

`discord_admins` - This is a comma-seperated list of role-ids or role-names
which are allowed to access [commands](#discord-commands).


## Telegram side
You should be joined in a public/private channel. This works with user accounts only
as it was intended for scraping purposes. Channel owners/admins which can add bridge
bots should use those as they're more polished. However they require setup from both
discord and telegram admins. In this case, only discord admins are needed which can
add the bot to the server.

## Discord commands
The prefix for the discord bot is `u!`. Only the bot owner and server Administrators
can execute these commands.

### `u!add`
This command allows you to associate a discord channel with one or more telegram channels

See example usage:

```py
# meta (telegram_ids can be separated with spaces for multiple channels)
u!add discord_id telegram_id(s)
```

```py
# post media from multiple channels to that single discord channel
u!add 1084482756345614438 -1001699258222 -1001983464181
```
```py
# post media from single telegram channel to single discord channel
u!add 1084482806064885882 -1001759446243
```

### `u!begin`
Start watching for updates in the specified telegram channels and post them on discord
```py
u!begin
```

### `u!dump`
Dump the saved json data in the discord chat. This is useful when you want to keep a record
of channels which were added in case of a bot restart.
```py
u!dump
```

### `u!ping`
Acknowledgement command that bot is able to receive and send messages.
```py
u!ping
```

### `u!save`
Save the temporary actions of the `u!add` command. This creates a physical file in the bot
command issuing directory on the server. It contains data in json format.

```py
u!save
```

### `u!stop`
Clear the internal channels list from where to fetch updates from.
This is equivalent to a reset but channels from pervious `u!save`
are still present. To start fresh, simply begin by using `u!add` and 
so on. If you wish to restart from previous configuration, simply
issue the `u!begin` command again.

## Typical Usage
- Working `login.json`
- Run `src/main.py`
- Make sure you have joined the channels on your telegram account
- Get correct telegram channel id(s), they start with `-` sign.
- If you get an id that starts with `-` but doesn't start like this `-100`
then put `-100` before it when you issue `u!add`
- On discord, issue `u!add`
- After that save it using `u!save`
- Start seeing the magic with `u!begin`

## Semantics
The bot will directly download and upload the media to discord if it is less than 7.5 Mega Bytes.
Otherwise, the bot will download it locally and then move it to `media_location` as specified in `login_copy.json`.
Then it will append the downlaoded file name to `media_url` and post a direct link to there.
